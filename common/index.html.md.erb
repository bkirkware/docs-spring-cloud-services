### Service Plans

Spring Cloud Services currently provides the following service plans:

| Plan Name             | Description                                                                         |
------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <code>trial</code>    | Service instances are free and are automatically deleted seven days after creation. |
| <code>standard</code> | Service instances are paid, at $39.99 per month.                                    |

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong> Service instances created using the <code>trial</code> plan are deleted automatically after seven days. Use this service plan for trial or demonstration purposes only.</p>

#### <code>trial</code> Service Instance Automatic Deletion

Service instances created using the `trial` plan are deleted seven days after creation. You can use this plan to create service instances for trial or demonstration purposes for short-term usage. Do not rely on the `trial` plan for service instances used in production.
