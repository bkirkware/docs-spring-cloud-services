To find the dashboard, navigate in <%= vars.scs_platform_name %> Apps Manager to the Service Registry service instance's space, click the listing for the service instance, and then click **Manage**.

<%= image_tag(vars.scs_sr_using_dashboard_manage_link) %>

## <a id="dashboard-information"></a>Dashboard Information

The dashboard shows the URL of the Service Registry service instance, the count of backing apps for the service instance (the High Availability or HA count), and the URLs of any peer service instances, as well as the apps currently registered with the service instance or with any peer service instances.

<%= image_tag(vars.scs_sr_using_dashboard_empty_dashboard_top) %>

If the Service Registry service instance has been configured to replicate its registry with any peers, peers are listed according to their status in the "replicas" fields under **General Info**. Peers which are registered with this service instance are listed in "registered-replicas" and, if currently in service, will be listed in "available-replicas". Peers which have been configured for this service instance but have not registered will be listed in "unavailable-replicas".

<%= image_tag(vars.scs_sr_using_dashboard_empty_dashboard_middle) %>

Before you have bound any apps to the Service Registry instance, the Service Registry dashboard displays only `EUREKA-SERVER` (the Service Registry backing app itself) under "Registered Apps". If you bind an app which uses ```@EnableDiscoveryClient``` to the service instance (see <a href="./writing-client-applications.html">Writing Client Applications</a>), restage the app, and wait for it to register with Eureka, you will see it listed in the dashboard.
