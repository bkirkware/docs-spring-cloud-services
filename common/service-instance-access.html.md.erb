## <a id="using-credhub"></a>Using CredHub for Service Instance Credentials

If the Spring Cloud Services tile has been configured to use the VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs CredHub to secure service instance credentials, an app's `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable will not include credentials for bound service instances. The environment variable will instead contain a CredHub reference for the service instance's credentials, as in the following example:

```
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "p-config-server": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "credhub-ref": "/c/p-spring-cloud-services/p-config-server/019e0b47-b06a-4291-a8b8-4a2a90c645f5/credentials-json"
    },
    "label": "p-config-server",
    "name": "config-server",
    "plan": "standard",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "configuration",
     "spring-cloud"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
 }
}
```

Service instance credentials secured using the PAS CredHub are securely provided to the bound app at runtime. For more information about CredHub, see the [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/credhub/index.html).
