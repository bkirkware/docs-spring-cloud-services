Release notes for [Spring Cloud Services for VMware Tanzu](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services)

## <a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues

### Cannot Update Credentials for Git Repositories That Use HTTP(S) URLs

In Spring Cloud Services v3.1.0--v3.1.5, you cannot update credentials for a Git repository that was originally added to a Config Server service instance using a HTTP or HTTPS URL. This means that if the repository's credentials are rotated, the Config Server's mirror service will be unable to update its mirror of the repository.

To resolve this issue, you can update the Config Server to use SSH, rather than HTTP or HTTPS, to access the Git repository. See [SSH Repository Access](./common/config-server/configuring-with-git.html#ssh-repository-access).

## <a id="3-1-3"></a>3.1.3

## <a id="3-1-0"></a>v3.1.0

**Release Date: 7th October 2019**

Enhancements included in this release:

* The Spring Cloud Services broker has been upgraded to Spring Boot 2.1.8.RELEASE and Spring Cloud Greenwich.SR3.
* Service Registry service has been added back with a new name: `p.service-registry`.
* The existing Service Registry configuration options have not changed although there is now a new option named `peer-timeout` that can be set in milliseconds. This can alleviate issues with peer replication timing out when there is higher latency in the network between peers.
* There is now a process for doing backup and restore of Spring Cloud Services stateful resources.

Important items to note:

* Spring Cloud Services v3.1.0 does not include Circuit Breaker Dashboard services. To use these services, you can install Spring Cloud Services v2.0.x alongside v3.1.0.
    <p class="warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: You cannot upgrade to Ops Manager v2.7 if you are running Spring Cloud Services v2.0.x.</p>
* The Circuit Breaker Dashboard service will not return, as the underlying Netflix OSS Hystrix Dashboard project has been deprecated.
