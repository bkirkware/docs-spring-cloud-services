Release notes for [Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services)

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Spring Cloud Services (SCS) 3.0.x and 2.0.x are separate tiles, and both use the <code>p-spring-cloud-services</code> org to deploy service instance backing apps. Deleting SCS v2.0.10 or earlier will delete this org, including any v3.0.x backing apps. See <a href="#known-issues">Known Issues</a>.</p>

## <a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues

### Spring Cloud Services 3.0.x Shares Org Used by 2.0.x

Spring Cloud Services (SCS) 3.0.x uses the `p-spring-cloud-services` org for deployment of backing apps for service instances. SCS v2.0.x, which is a separate tile, also uses this org. In SCS v2.0.10 and earlier, the **Broker Deregistrar** pre-delete lifecycle errand deletes the `p-spring-cloud-services` org. Because of this, deleting the v2.0.x tile will also affect the v3.0.x tile. Deletion of the `p-spring-cloud-services` org can result in loss of v3.0.x service instance backing apps, potentially affecting client apps bound to the service instances.

**If you have installed Spring Cloud Services v3.0.x alongside v2.0.10 or earlier, do NOT delete the v2.0.x tile.**

IMPORTANT: This is resolved by upgrading to SCS 2.0.11 tile and SCS 3.0.4 tile versions before deleting the SCS 2.0.x tile.

## <a id="3-0-4"></a>3.0.4

**Release Date: 9th August 2019**

* Fixed issue where uninstall of SCS versions prior to 3.0.0 could cause service broker to no longer work. (IMPORTANT: Upgrade to SCS 2.0.11 to ensure there is no impact to SCS 3.0.x service instances along with upgrading to SCS 3.0.4 to ensure continued service.)
* Added section on Config Server dashboard to show currently mirrored Git hash for each repository configured.
* Resolved issue when uninstalling the tile where it would sometimes fail on first attempt.

## <a id="3-0-3"></a>3.0.3

**Release Date: 29th July 2019**

* Added ability to synchronize Git mirrors via a button on the Config Server's dashboard.
* Added tile dependency on PAS to ensure that on a brand-new PCF installation, PAS is installed before the Spring Cloud Services tile.
* Added ability to use `cf update-service` to upgrade existing `p.config-server` service instances to the most recent version offered by the service broker.

## <a id="3-0-2"></a>3.0.2

**Release Date: 31st May 2019**

* Fixed issue with `cf` CLI display of service instances and marketplace services.

## <a id="3-0-1"></a>3.0.1

**Release Date: 30th May 2019**

**IMPORTANT: Known Issue**

Running the `cf services` or `cf marketplace` commands results in the following error response:

```
json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field ServiceExtra.Shareable of
type bool
```

This affects the display of all service instances in a space when using the cf CLI.

**Recommended Actions**

Given the impact of users being unable to view the current state of their service instances in a space, Pivotal recommends that you do not install or upgrade to version 3.0.1. If you have already installed it, please upgrade to version 3.0.2, which resolves this issue.

Enhancements included in this release:

* Fixed issue with Config Server service instances not updating correctly if created with no Git repositories configured.
* Fixed Apps Manager name, description and icon for Config Server service in Marketplace.

## <a id="3-0-0"></a>3.0.0

**Release Date: 21st May 2019**

Enhancements included in this release:

* Spring Cloud Services 3.0.0 runs alongside previous versions (2.0.x and 1.5.x) and adds a new service, named `p.config-server`, to the PCF Marketplace. Operators and developers may decide to migrate existing `p-config-server` service instances over to the new service and then disable use of the old service once existing service instances are fully migrated.
* The Spring Cloud Services broker has been upgraded to Spring Boot 2.1.4.RELEASE and Spring Cloud Greenwich.RC1.
* The Config Server service now mirrors Git repositories local to the PCF foundation. This reduces communication required with external Git servers and improves data governance options for configuration values served by the Config Server from Git repositories, as well as increasing availability of the Config Server.
* The Config Server service now includes support for a CredHub backend, which can be used for secrets management. The new backend removes the need to store secrets in encrypted form within Git for use by the Config Server and improves the security of secret management for Config Server client applications. (The Config Server continues to include support for a HashiCorp Vault backend.)

Important items to note:

* Spring Cloud Services 3.0.0 does not include Service Registry or Circuit Breaker Dashboard services. To use these services, you can install Spring Cloud Services 2.0.x alongside 3.0.0.
* The Circuit Breaker Dashboard service will not return, as the underlying Netflix OSS Hystrix Dashboard project has been deprecated.

Known issue:

* A Config Server service instance that is created without any Git repositories configured cannot be updated or deleted.
