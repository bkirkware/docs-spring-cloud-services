Release notes for [Pivotal Spring Cloud Services](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services)

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Spring Cloud Services (SCS) v3.0.x and v2.0.x are separate tiles, and both use the <code>p-spring-cloud-services</code> org to deploy service instance backing apps. Deleting SCS v2.0.10 or earlier will delete this org, including any v3.0.x backing apps. See <a href="#known-issues">Known Issues</a>. Pivotal recommends upgrading and migrating completely to SCS v3.1.x. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/3-1/product-upgrades.html">Upgrading Pivotal Spring Cloud Services</a>. </p>

## <a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues

### Spring Cloud Services 3.0.6 tile installation/upgrade issue

In environments that have installed other tiles, SCS v3.0.6 may not install properly due to potential conflicting component versions and naming convention. Upgrade SCS v3.0.x tile installations to SCS v3.0.7+ or upgrade and migrate your services to SCS v3.1.x.

### Spring Cloud Services 3.0.x Shares Org Used by 2.0.x

Spring Cloud Services (SCS) v3.0.x uses the `p-spring-cloud-services` org for deployment of backing apps for service instances. SCS v2.0.x, which is a separate tile, also uses this org. In SCS v2.0.10 and earlier, the **Broker Deregistrar** pre-delete lifecycle errand deletes the `p-spring-cloud-services` org. Because of this, deleting the v2.0.x tile will also affect the v3.0.x tile. Deletion of the `p-spring-cloud-services` org can result in loss of v3.0.x service instance backing apps, potentially affecting client apps bound to the service instances.

**If you have installed Spring Cloud Services v3.0.x alongside v2.0.10 or earlier, do NOT delete the v2.0.x tile.** If you do wish to delete the 2.0.x tile, upgrade to SCS v3.0.4 or later and SCS v2.0.11 or later, then delete the v2.0.x tile.

### Circuit Breaker Dashboard Not Supported in v3.0.x

* Spring Cloud Services v3.0.x does not include Service Registry or Circuit Breaker Dashboard services. To use these services, you can install Spring Cloud Services v2.0.x alongside v3.0.x.
    <p class="warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: You cannot upgrade to Ops Manager v2.7 if you are running Spring Cloud Services v2.0.x.</p>
* The Circuit Breaker Dashboard service will not return, as the underlying Netflix OSS Hystrix Dashboard project has been deprecated.

## <a id="3-0-11"></a>3.0.11

**Release Date: 22nd January 2020**

* Fixed issue with Git default label configuration.
* Further improved fix for rotating Certificate Authorities while maintaining certificate uniqueness in errand JVM truststore.

## <a id="3-0-8"></a>3.0.8

**Release Date: 28th October 2019**

* Resolved issue with accessing service instance dashboard when Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile is configured with "Authentication and Enterprise SSO" as SAML.

## <a id="3-0-7"></a>3.0.7

**Release Date: 7th October 2019**

* Fixed problem with tile installations having conflicting compiled components.

## <a id="3-0-6"></a>3.0.6 (DO NOT USE)

**Release Date: 26th September 2019**

* Upgraded to Spring Cloud Greenwich.SR3.

## <a id="3-0-5"></a>3.0.5

**Release Date: 29th August 2019**

* On Config Server service instance's dashboard, added display of current Git commit hash value for each of the service instance's configured Git repositories.
* Fixed issue where Git basic authentication credentials were displayed inside `sourceUri` value on Config Server service instance's dashboard.

## <a id="3-0-4"></a>3.0.4

**Release Date: 9th August 2019**

* Fixed issue that caused uninstalling an SCS version prior to 3.0.0 could cause the service broker to no longer work. **To ensure that uninstalling SCS 2.0.x causes no impact to SCS 3.0.x service instances, upgrade SCS 2.0.x to v2.0.11 and upgrade SCS 3.0.x to 3.0.4 before deleting SCS 2.0.x.**
* Added a section on the Config Server dashboard to show the currently-mirrored Git hash of each Git repository configured for the Config Server service instance.
* Resolved issue that could cause uninstallation of SCS 3.0.x to fail on first attempt.

## <a id="3-0-3"></a>3.0.3

**Release Date: 29th July 2019**

* Added ability to synchronize Git mirrors via a button on the Config Server's dashboard.
* Added tile dependency on PAS to ensure that on a brand-new PCF installation, PAS is installed before the Spring Cloud Services tile.
* Added ability to use `cf update-service` to upgrade existing `p.config-server` service instances to the most recent version offered by the service broker.

## <a id="3-0-2"></a>3.0.2

**Release Date: 31st May 2019**

* Fixed issue with `cf` CLI display of service instances and marketplace services.

## <a id="3-0-1"></a>3.0.1

**Release Date: 30th May 2019**

**IMPORTANT: Known Issue**

Running the `cf services` or `cf marketplace` commands results in the following error response:

```
json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field ServiceExtra.Shareable of
type bool
```

This affects the display of all service instances in a space when using the cf CLI.

**Recommended Actions**

Given the impact of users being unable to view the current state of their service instances in a space, Pivotal recommends that you do not install or upgrade to version 3.0.1. If you have already installed it, please upgrade to version 3.0.2, which resolves this issue.

Enhancements included in this release:

* Fixed issue with Config Server service instances not updating correctly if created with no Git repositories configured.
* Fixed Apps Manager name, description and icon for Config Server service in Marketplace.

## <a id="3-0-0"></a>3.0.0

**Release Date: 21st May 2019**

Enhancements included in this release:

* Spring Cloud Services 3.0.0 runs alongside previous versions (2.0.x and 1.5.x) and adds a new service, named `p.config-server`, to the PCF Marketplace. Operators and developers may decide to migrate existing `p-config-server` service instances over to the new service and then disable use of the old service once existing service instances are fully migrated.
* The Spring Cloud Services broker has been upgraded to Spring Boot 2.1.4.RELEASE and Spring Cloud Greenwich.RC1.
* The Config Server service now mirrors Git repositories local to the PCF foundation. This reduces communication required with external Git servers and improves data governance options for configuration values served by the Config Server from Git repositories, as well as increasing availability of the Config Server.
* The Config Server service now includes support for a CredHub backend, which can be used for secrets management. The new backend removes the need to store secrets in encrypted form within Git for use by the Config Server and improves the security of secret management for Config Server client applications. (The Config Server continues to include support for a HashiCorp Vault backend.)

Known issue:

* A Config Server service instance that is created without any Git repositories configured cannot be updated or deleted.
