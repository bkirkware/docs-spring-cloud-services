Release notes for [Pivotal Spring Cloud Services](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services)

## <a id="3-1-3"></a>3.1.3

**Release Date: 25th November 2019**

* Fixed issue when rotating Certificate Authorities while maintaining certificate uniqueness in errand JVM truststore.

## <a id="3-1-2"></a>3.1.2

**Release Date: 14th November 2019**

* Fixed CredHub bootstrapper errand so that it can update client credential permissions when re-running after tile install failure.

## <a id="3-1-1"></a>3.1.1

**Release Date: 28th October 2019**

* Resolved issue with accessing service instance dashboard when Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile is configured with "Authentication and Enterprise SSO" as SAML.

## <a id="3-1-0"></a>v3.1.0

**Release Date: 7th October 2019**

Enhancements included in this release:

* The Spring Cloud Services broker has been upgraded to Spring Boot 2.1.8.RELEASE and Spring Cloud Greenwich.SR3.
* Service Registry service has been added back with a new name: `p.service-registry`.
* The existing Service Registry configuration options have not changed although there is now a new option named `peer-timeout` that can be set in milliseconds. This can alleviate issues with peer replication timing out when there is higher latency in the network between peers.
* There is now a process for doing backup and restore of Spring Cloud Services stateful resources.

Important items to note:

* Spring Cloud Services v3.1.0 does not include Circuit Breaker Dashboard services. To use these services, you can install Spring Cloud Services v2.0.x alongside v3.1.0.
    <p class="warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: You cannot upgrade to Ops Manager v2.7 if you are running Spring Cloud Services v2.0.x.</p>
* The Circuit Breaker Dashboard service will not return, as the underlying Netflix OSS Hystrix Dashboard project has been deprecated.
