After upgrading the Spring Cloud Services product, you can follow the below steps to upgrade an individual service instance or to upgrade all service instances. You can also use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) to upgrade an individual service instance; see [Service Instance Upgrades](./common/service-instance-upgrades.html) for more information.

1. To see the current version of a service instance, visit the Service Instances dashboard. (See the [Service Instances Dashboard](./service-instances.html#service-instances-dashboard) section of [Service Instances](./service-instances.html).)
