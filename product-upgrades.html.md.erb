VMware recommends that you upgrade to and migrate all your service instances 
to Spring Cloud Services v3.1.x.

After migration to SCS v3.1.x, you can remove any earlier versions of Spring Cloud Services.

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/3-1/product-upgrades.html">Upgrading Spring Cloud Services for VMware Tanzu</a>.

## <a id="service-instance-changes"></a> Service Changes

Spring Cloud Services 3.0.x includes only the Config Server service. This service has a new name, `p.config-server` (instead of `p-config-server` as in earlier versions of Spring Cloud Services). This service can be offered alongside, but does not replace, earlier versions of Config Server. VMware recommends disabling the older `p-config-server` service after installing Spring Cloud Services 3.0.x (which includes the `p.config-server` service).

For more information about running Spring Cloud Services v3.0.x alongside earlier versions, see the [Running Alongside Previous Versions](./installation.html#running-alongside-previous-versions) section of [Installing Spring Cloud Services for VMware Tanzu](./installation.html).
